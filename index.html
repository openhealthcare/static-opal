            <p>
              By reducing duplication of work and ensuring that new information
              is immediately available to everyone who needs it, teams can work more
              efficiently and improve communication.

              Accountability
            </h3>
            <p>
              The extra data captured and the ease of reporting provided by OPAL
              allows a much greater degree of visibility into what's happening on wards,
              allowing audit trails on data that would otherwise be lost as patients are discharged.

              Safety

            <p>
              Patient safety is of paramount importance, and with OPAL, the chances
              of information getting lost on bits of paper is greatly reduced.

            <p>
              By storing information that would otherwise never have been collected,
              in a format that can be easily queried, OPAL opens up a new research space
              for academics and researchers.

          <i>Opal solves the patient list problem.</i>
        </h2>
        <p class="justify">
          The patient list problem is this: Doctors need ready access to the core information needed to look
          after their patients such as who their patients are and where they are, what's wrong with them, what
          the plan is, and what progress has been made against the plan.... The widespread, but suboptimal,
          solution to this problem is to use a table in a Microsoft Word Document.
